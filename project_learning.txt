1=> always wrap a navbar or a main div or component inside a container so we can just add the width to it 
    and wrap all the elements inside the container.

2=> always add a css reset on * and use box-sizing- border-box so we can work properly with height and width

3 => always use width:100% to the image so it can be fit to it's container and can not grow eventaully as per size
